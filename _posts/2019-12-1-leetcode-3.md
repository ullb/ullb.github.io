---
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

## Example 1:
> Input: "abcabcbb"  
> Output: 3  
> Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3. 

## Example 2:
> Input: "bbbbb"  
> Output: 1  
> Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.

## Example 3:
> Input: "pwwkew"  
> Output: 3  
> Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3. Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

## Answer:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLongestSubstring(string s) {
        int record[256];
        memset(record, -1, sizeof(record));
        int res = 0;
        int start = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); ++i) {
            if (record[s[i]] != -1) {
                start = max(start, record[s[i]] + 1);
            }
            record[s[i]] = i;
            res = max(res, i - start + 1);
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
